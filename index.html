    <h1>DEMO FOR RESPONSIVE BREATH LIGHT</h1>
    <div class="column">
      <div class="start">
        <p>
          This is quick a demo to show how to achieve a responsive breath light which is positioned correctly while the amber box resizes according to screen size. Since it is made up for demostration, older browser compatibility is not considered and latest css3 property are used without browser prefixes, so make sure you are using latest browser while viewing it. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The mobile view breaks at 640px, and the maximum width for the strip is set to 1000px, so when browser width is larger than 1000px you won't see the strip resizes.
        </p>
        <p>
           Keep shrinking the browser to see the ambox resizing according to sceen width.
